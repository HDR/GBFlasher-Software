Under Windows we recommend to use binary install package, unless you want to
improve this software. There is possibility of adding new translations for
not yet supported languages. Process of making translation files is described

realizing direct access to USB hardware.
It's important to USE USB VERSION WITH ROOT PRIVILEGES!
